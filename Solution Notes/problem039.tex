		We can use Euclid's formula to solve this one.
		
		\begin{align}
			a &= k(m^2-n^2)
			b &= k(2mn)
			c &= k(m^2+n^2)
		\end{align}
		
		This set of equations will generate all of the Pythagorean triples provided that \(m>n\) and that \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime and not both odd. This makes the problem easy.
		
		Further we can provide constrains on the values of $m$ and $n$ given the problem statement that \(p \le 1000\). From this we can put an upper bound on \(c < 1000\) since if any of the three were 1000, this would exceed the perimeter by definition. Then we have a bound on \(k\) which is that \(k(m^2+n^2\le 1000\) and given that the smallest values of $m$ and $n$ are 2 and 1 respectively, the upper bound on k is:
		
		\[k \le 1000/5 = 200\]
		
		Then we can make constraints on $m$ and $n$ similarly using the same relation. For n:
		
		\[n\le \sqrt{1000-m^2}\rightarrow n\le \sqrt{1000-4}\]
		
		And using a floor function on the square root, we find \(n \le 31\). by the exact same principles, we find \(m \le 31\) as well.
